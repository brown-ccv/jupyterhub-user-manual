# Create GitHub Account

## **Step 0: Create a GitHub Account \(if you don't have one\)**

In order to use github and github classroom, you must first create a github account \(if you already have an existing account, you can skip this step\). To create an account, go to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) and complete the account creation process. We recommend you use an  username that will easily allow your professor or students to identify you.
