# Configure Git and GitHub

We recommend syncying content to and from JupyterHub using Git and GitHub. However, before you can start we need to tell Git and GitHub who we are. JupyterHub contains an utility program that simplifies the process of this configuration which consists of the following steps

1. Make sure you have your **GitHub User Handle** and **Password**
2. [Launch a terminal session ](../getting-started/launch-a-terminal-session.md)
3. In the terminal type the following command \(replace user and credential details\) `gitconfig  -n "First Last" -e "my_github_email@domain.com  -u githubuser` 
4. Type your password
5. Typer `yes` when prompted whether to add github to the list on known hosts
6. You are all set to start using Git and GitHub inside JupyterHub!
7.
