# Possible workflows

## All lectures (per semester) in one repository

This is probably the simplest option. We recommend to name the repository according to the current semester. For instance:

[brown-jupyterhub/sample_lectures_fall_18](https://github.com/brown-jupyterhub/sample_lectures_fall_18)

- The simplest is to keep the repository public, that way all students can *clone it*  freely
- You can keep a private version with all your reference lectures and simply add lectures, one at a time
- If you don't wish to have your lecture material public to the world, the you can distribute the lecture material as an assignment, with no deadline

## Lecture per repository

This likely adds more book-keeping that its necessary, but has the advantage of controlling, dependencies and settings on a per lecture base. You may want to use this setup, for lectures that have unique or more complicated dependencies.
