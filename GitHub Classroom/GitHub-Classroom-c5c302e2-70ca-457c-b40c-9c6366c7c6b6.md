## Why use GitHub Classroom:

- **Introduce students to *version control**,* one of the most important and foundational practices in software engineering.
- **Spend more time with students, less on setup:** Students accept an assignment with one link, so you can get straight to the material.
- **Bootstrap group assignments in a snap:** Invite students to a shared repository, and cap the number of students per group. Use the same groups over and over again, or create new ones.
- **Download all repositories with the click of a button:** When you're ready to grade, download assignments to your machine from GitHub Classroom, or use our new desktop client, Classroom Assistant.
- **More insight into student work than ever before:** See when students accept the assignment, and access their work from the moment they start. With version control, catch when they get stuck and help them rewind.
- **You are in control:** Students can work individually or in groups, in public or in private. Set permissions for teaching assistants or graders.
- **Scales for large courses with ease:** If you have a small course, Classroom will make your life easier and save you time. If you have hundreds of students, we have your covered: as many repositories as you need, and webhooks to integrate automated testing tools.
- **Works with your Learning Management System (LMS):** Students submit a link to their assignment repository to your learning management system. Give feedback through comments in GitHub, but keep grades in your LMS.
- **Are you super-advanced?** Do you want to build your own tools? GitHub Classroom isÂ [open source](https://github.com/education/classroom), and we ðŸ’– contributions.
