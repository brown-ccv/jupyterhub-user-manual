# Creating a New Blank Notebook

## Creating a Notebook on JupyterHub

{% hint style="danger" %}
Notebooks created and stored on locally\(the cloud\) on the JupyterHub will persist between logins, but will not have any long-term redundant backups . Should you lose permissions to access the hub \(i.e., end of semester\), or should the hub crash, these files may be lost.
{% endhint %}

1. Select the local![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-from-2018-09-19-09-14-01.png)File Browser from left sidebar

3. Click **Python 3** under the **Notebook** section
4. A new “Unititled\(\#\).ipynb” file will appear in your current working drive directory and a blank Notebook will launch. Click on "Untitled" to change the name of the file
