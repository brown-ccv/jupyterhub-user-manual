3. Select the files you would like to upload and click **Open**
4. The files will be automatically added to your hub at your current working directory level.

## Import via URL

Instructors have the ability to generate an URL that will place the appropiate content in you hub. If you are an Instructor, please refer to the [nbgitpuller guide](../content-sync-via-link/nbgitpuller.md) to generate links.

## Import from Git/GitHub Repository

Many courses at Brown use GitHub and GitHub classroom to distribute lecture and homework material.  If your class uses GitHub and GitHub classroom for content distrubution, you should review the sections **CONTENT SYNC VIA GIT,** and **GITHUB CLASSROOM** from the left navigation bar.
