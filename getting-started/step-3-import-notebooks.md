# Import Notebooks

Depending on your class requirements and on your level of familiarity with version control, there are different recommended ways to sync files to and from your hub. We list several options below.

## Adding Files From Your Desktop ①

The File Uploaded tool offers the easiest approach for students to add files to your hub.

1. Select ![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-from-2018-09-19-09-14-01.png)File browser from left sidebar
2. Select the ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2812%29.png)Upload Files button 
3. Select the files you would like to upload and click **Open**
4. The files will be automatically added to your hub at your current working directory level.

## Import via URL ①

Ⓣ Teachers have the ability to generate an URL that will place the appropriate content in your hub. If you are an Instructor, please refer to the [Link Generation Section](https://github.com/brown-ccv/jupyterhub-user-manual/tree/20137a65ca239a03588945cb5fba05b62d1c5f98/content-sync-via-link/nbgitpuller.md).

Ⓢ Students will simply need to clink the link posted in Canvas. Note that if the content is updated by the instructor, then visiting the link again will bring the new content.

## Import from Git/GitHub Repository ②

Many courses at Brown use GitHub and GitHub classroom to distribute lecture and homework material. If your class uses GitHub and GitHub classroom for content distribution, you should review the sections [**CONTENT SYNC VIA GIT,**](https://github.com/brown-ccv/jupyterhub-user-manual/tree/20137a65ca239a03588945cb5fba05b62d1c5f98/git-basics/overview.md) **\*\*and \[**GITHUB CLASSROOM**\]\(../github-classroom-student-guide/overview.md\) \*\***from the left navigation bar.
