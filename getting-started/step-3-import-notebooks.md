# Import Notebooks

Depending on your class requirements and on your level of familiarity with version control, there are different recommended ways to sync files to and from your hub. We list several options below.

## Adding Files From Your Desktop

The File Uploaded tool offers the easiest approach for students to add files to your hub. 

1. Select ![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-from-2018-09-19-09-14-01.png)File browser from left sidebar
2. Select the ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2812%29.png)Upload Files button 
3. Select the files you would like to upload and click **Open**
4. The files will be automatically added to your hub at your current working directory level.

## Import via URL

Instructors have the ability to generate an URL that will place the appropriate content in your hub. If you are an Instructor, please refer to the [nbgitpuller guide](../content-sync-via-link/nbgitpuller.md) to generate links.

## Import from Git/GitHub Repository

Many courses at Brown use GitHub and GitHub classroom to distribute lecture and homework material.  If your class uses GitHub and GitHub classroom for content distribution, you should review the sections [**CONTENT SYNC VIA GIT,**](https://app.gitbook.com/@brown-cis/s/jupyterhub/~/edit/drafts/-LmHpZ4Tjahf8C-b7vvT/git-basics/overview) ****and [**GITHUB CLASSROOM**](https://app.gitbook.com/@brown-cis/s/jupyterhub/~/edit/drafts/-LmHpZ4Tjahf8C-b7vvT/github-classroom-student-guide/overview) ****from the left navigation bar.
