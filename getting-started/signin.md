## Before Getting Started

 Prior to accessing Brownâ€™s JupyterHub, you will need the following:

*  A supported web browser \(Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge\)
*  Be enrolled in a course at Brown that utilizes JupyterHub \(ask your professor\)
*  Have read through the [Computing Policies Terms of Service Agreement](../computing-policy.md#brown-jupyterhub-terms-and-service-agreement)

## Sign In

 Start using JupyterHub by signing in to your account for your class.

1.  Go to [https://\[department\].jupyter.brown.edu](https://dev.jupyter.brown.edu) and click "Sign in with Brown Gmail Login"  _**NOTE: \(replace \[department\] with your corresponding course department, ie: phys for Physics 70 or Physics 1400 etc.**_
2.  Enter your Brown email address \(example: john\_doe@brown.edu\) and password

Once authenticated, you should automatically be logged in and a JupyterHub server will begin launching. A status bar will appear with detailed information regarding your server startup.
