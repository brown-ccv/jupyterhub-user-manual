# JupyterHub for  Physics 70

Welcome to your Getting Started Guide for JupyterHub. Your JupyterHub is designed to provide an environment to run Jupyter Notebooks for Python without the need to install any software or packages. JupyterHub is interacted with completely through a web browser. This service is a collaboration supported by various teams in CIS.

If you are an instructor looking to request a JupyterHub for your course or workshop, please visit this [link](https://ccv.brown.edu/services/consulting/jupyterhub/).

## What Do You Get?

On the Brown JupyterHub, each user is provided their own persistent working directory and compute resource allocation unique from each other user. This means the environment you are provided is only accessible by yourself and CIS support staff.

Once connected to your server, you are provided an isolated workspace where you can write and run code. There are no time limit restrictions or specified lockout times, so please feel free to use your personal JupyterHub notebook server anytime you want and adhere to [CCV's Computing Policies](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/jupyterhub/computing-policy)
