# Interface Overview

## JupyterLab

JupyterLab is the next generation web-interface for Jupyter Notebooks. It enables you to use side by side view, text editors, terminals, data file viewers, markdown preview and other custom components along with notebooks. Highlighted features are:

* Drag-and-drop to reorder notebook cells and copy them between notebooks.
* Run code blocks interactively from text files \(.py, .R, .md, .tex, etc.\).
* Link a code console to a notebook kernel to explore code interactively without cluttering up the notebook with temporary scratch work.
* Edit popular file formats with live preview, such as Markdown, JSON, CSV, Vega, VegaLite, and more.
