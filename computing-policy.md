# Computing Policies

## Brown JupyterHub Terms and Service Agreement

GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

All use of Center facilities and services is at the discretion of the Center Director.

All use of Center facilities must conform to established University policies as published in documents held at \[[https://it.brown.edu/computing-policies](https://it.brown.edu/computing-policies)\].

Accounts on Center equipment are to be used only by the named individual holder of the account. Users may not share passwords or accounts with anyone. Misuse or unauthorized access is prohibited, and is subject to University sanction and/or criminal and civil penalties. The Center's support staff may, in the course of providing support to a user, access the Center's systems and the user's files through that user's account. Before doing so, permission will be required from the user either in person or in writing.

All software and data stored or used on Center and hosted systems must be appropriately and legally acquired and must be used in compliance with applicable licensing terms. Unauthorized misuse or copying of copyrighted materials is prohibited. The storage of any sensitive data must comply with all appropriate laws or protocols, such as those imposed by Protection of Human Subjects procedures, and the Center should be notified of the location of such data.

In addition, users certify compliance with all U.S. export control laws and regulations and are responsible for obtaining export control licenses as may be required before exporting controlled data, information software, or other technology to foreign countries or providing access to foreign persons.

Papers and publications resulting from use of Center facilities must acknowledge this via the inclusion of an appropriate credit similar to the following: "This work was supported by Brown University through the use of the facilities of its Computing and Information Services." 

Interruptions in Center resource operations and services may be due to planned maintenance or other, unforeseen cause. Users will be notified whether or not maintenance will occur and what systems will be affected at least one week in advance of the maintenance period.

Emergency system changes may also be necessary to correct hardware or software failures, or to patch security vulnerabilities in systems software. Such changes will be announced with the longest notice possible.

## Computing Policies

The following documents are official policies of Brown University that are related to computing issues. They have been adopted to ensure an equitable, appropriate, and legal use of Brown resources. You are therefore responsible for having reviewed the listed policies and for complying with their requirements. Violation of a computing-related policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including suspension or termination.

In order for policies to be officially approved and published as final, they must go through a formal policy review process. Should the need arise to have a policy published before the process is complete, the document will be published as an interim policy while the process is completed.
