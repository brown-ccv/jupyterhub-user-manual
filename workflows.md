# Workflows

Depending on how familiar students are to _Version Control_ technologies such as _**Git**_, different workflows may fit best the strategy used to distribute coding materials and assignments. 

## ① Distribute using a \(puller\) link

This is the simplest way to distribute materials to your students. 

#### Requirements:

* Instructor will need a GitHub account, organization and repository to upload materials to.

#### Related sections in the documentation \(look for  ① in the title\):

👩‍💻Students only need to be familiar with [Getting Started ](github-classroom-student-guide/overview.md) and [Getting Support](help-and-support/getting-support.md) sections

## ② Distribute via GitHub Classroom

Using Git and GitHub to distribute your materials encourages best practices for software development and additionally adds versioning to changes made to the source code, allowing students to revert to prior versions if necessary. If you will be using Git, we recommend using _**GitHub Classroom**_  to help automate the process.  

#### Related sections in the documentation \(look for  ② in the title\):

👩‍💻Students  should familiarize themselves with:  

* Content Sync via GIT
* GitHub Classroom \(Student Guide\)

👨‍🏫Instructors should familiarize themselves with:

* Content Sync via Link
* Content Sync via GIT
* GitHub Classroom \(Instructor Guide\)
