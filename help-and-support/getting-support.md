# Getting Support

We hope you are enjoying Jupyter Hub. This is a pilot project, supported by Brown Computing Information Services \(CIS\). We are a small team at the moment and therefore support is somewhat limited. We have created few mediums for you to see assitance. 

* Please check the **FAQ** section in this book
* For general **usage questions,**  we encourage you to take advantage of the **Jupyter Hub user Forum:**

* If you are experiencing **technical issues**, for instance, the Hub appears to be down or you have access issues, you can email [ **jupyter-help@brown.edu**](mailto:%20jupyter-help@brown.edu)\*\*\*\*
