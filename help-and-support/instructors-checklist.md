# Instructor's Checklist

* Share the [Brown University JupyterHub Guide](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/jupyterhub)  to all students. 
* If planning to use hub during class time, have the students launch their hubs at the very beginning of class \(can experience a few minutes of bootup time if large spike active hubs\)
* You can view the actively logged in hubs by clicking the "Admin" tab at the top of your JupyterHub session \(or by visiting [https://&lt;yourclassid&gt;.\[jupyter.brown.edu/hub/admin\]\(http://jupyter.brown.edu/hub/admin\)\](https://<yourclassid>.[jupyter.brown.edu/hub/admin]%28http://jupyter.brown.edu/hub/admin%29\)\)
* Students can install their own python packages using the user-specific install flag. As an example, to install &lt;package&gt;, use `pip install --user <package>`
* Is a required package missing? Hub crashing? Need more computational resources? Student having an issue you cannot resolve? Don't hesitate to email us at [jupyter-help@brown.edu](mailto:jupyter-help@brown.edu)

If you are using Git and GitHub Classroom

* Create and share your GitHub classroom invite link with students
* Remind students to push to their github repo at the end of every session \(or whenever they make major progress on a project\). Instructions are in JupyterHub guide above.
