# Instructor's Checklist

* Create and share your GitHub classroom invite link with students
* Share the [Brown University JupyterHub Guide](https://brown-cis.gitbook.io/) \([https://brown-cis.gitbook.io/](https://brown-cis.gitbook.io/)\) to all students. Specifically the sections [Getting Started](https://brown-cis.gitbook.io/project/getting-started/signin) and [GitHub Classroom \(Student Guide\)](https://brown-cis.gitbook.io/project/github-classroom-student-guide/overview).
* Remind students to push to their github repo at the end of every session \(or whenever they make major progress on a project\). Instructions are in JupyterHub guide above.
* If planning to use hub during class time, have the students launch their hubs at the very beginning of class \(can experience a few minutes of bootup time if large spike active hubs\)
* You can view the actively logged in hubs by clicking the "Admin" tab at the top of your JupyterHub session \(or by visiting https://&lt;yourclassid&gt;.[jupyter.brown.edu/hub/admin](http://jupyter.brown.edu/hub/admin)\)
* Students can install their own python packages using the user-specific install flag. As an example, to install &lt;package&gt;, use pip install --user &lt;package&gt;
* Is a required package missing? Hub crashing? Need more computational resources? Student having an issue you cannot resolve? Don't hesitate to email us at [jupyter-help@brown.edu](mailto:jupyter-help@brown.edu)
